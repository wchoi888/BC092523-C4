# Web Development Quiz Game

This webpage is a Web Development Quiz Game. It is an interactive quiz designed to test your web development knowledge. It features five multiple-choice questions, with only one correct answer for each. At the end of the Game, your score and initials will be saved. There is a history saved in the local storage of your web browser for player initials and score history.

## Usage

In the Web Development Quiz Game, you can test your web development knowledge by clicking the "Start" button, which initiates a 20-second timer and presents you with a set of 5 questions. You select answers for each question, earning +1 point for each correct answer while losing 2 seconds from the timer for incorrect ones. The highest possible score is 5 points, making it a challenging and time-sensitive quiz. Try to answer as many questions correctly as you can within the time limit to maximize your score.

## Credits

I copied a few lines of code for the timer function from the Bootcamp Web-API mini project solution.
